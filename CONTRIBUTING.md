# Contribution Guidelines:

## Style Guide :
- We'd be making use of the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" >PEP-8 Style guide</a>.
- ### Comment Guide :
  - Give brief overviews of what blocks of code are about.
  - Write about the why, not the how (if how the code works isn't obvious).
  

## Bugs, Features or Code Changes :
- In the case of fixing reported bugs, reference the issue number in the commit message
- If the bug is undocumented, describe the bug in the commit message
- Every new feature or code change should be written in a separate branch from dev.
- Write tests to cover any code changes before making pull requests.
- Always pull before making a pull request to a branch.
